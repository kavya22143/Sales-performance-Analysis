Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis Using Power BI

Description:

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data to uncover key insights and improve decision-making. Using Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard that tracks sales performance across regions, products, and time periods. The analysis includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, sales growth, top-performing products, customer segmentation, and profit margins.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Identify trends and patterns in sales data.

Compare actual sales to targets.

Detect underperforming regions or products.

Forecast future sales using historical data.

By leveraging Power BI's dynamic visuals and data modeling capabilities, the project helps businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize their sales strategies effectively.
